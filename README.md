**D3** (or **D3.js**) is a JavaScript library for visualizing data using web standards. D3 helps you bring data to life using SVG, Canvas and HTML. D3 combines powerful visualization and interaction techniques with a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation, giving you the full capabilities of modern browsers and the freedom to design the right visual interface for your data.

## About
**D5** is where **D**an **D**oes **D**ata-**D**riven **D**ocuments. A repository meant to focus on created small to large applications using the D3.js library. Intentions are to learn and gain experience working with D3 while creating stunning, beautiful visualizations of data. Projects are broken down into three parts:  
* [Crawl](https://github.com/ziggysauce/d5/tree/master/crawl) -- Introductory- to intermediate-level apps (vanilla JS)
* [Walk](https://github.com/ziggysauce/d5/tree/master/walk) -- Introductory to intermediate-level apps (ReactJS)
* [Run](https://github.com/ziggysauce/d5/tree/master/run) -- Advanced-level apps
